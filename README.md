It deals with the evaluation of harmonic content, to control output voltage and to reduce the total harmonic distortion in Cascaded H-Bridge Five level inverter. The MATLAB simulation model of solar photovoltaic (PV) connected CHB Multilevel Inverter by SVPWM technique was completed using artificial neural network methodology. In the proposed model the artificial neural network was used for two purposes, firstly in solar photovoltaic (PV) system for MPPT control to trigger IGBT in the boost converter and secondly to control Cascaded H-Bridge Five level Inverter.
